"Suppose one is able to observe sequentially a series of independent observations $X_1, X_2, \\ldots$, such that $X_1, X_2, \\ldots, X_{\\nu - 1}$ are i.i.d. with known density $f_0$ and $X_\\nu, X_{\\nu + 1}, \\ldots$ are i.i.d. with density $f_\\theta$ where $\\nu$ is unknown. Define $R(n, \\theta) = \\sum^n_{k = 1} \\prod^n_{i = k} \\frac{f_\\theta(X_i)}{f_0(X_i)}.$ It is known that rules, which call for stopping and raising an alarm the first time $n$ that $R(n, \\theta)$ or a mixture thereof exceeds a prespecified level $A$, are optimal methods of detecting that the density of the observations is not $f_0$ any more. Practical applications of such stopping rules require knowledge of their operating characteristics, whose exact evaluation is difficult. Here are presented asymptotic $(A \\rightarrow \\infty)$ expressions for the expected stopping times of such stopping rules (a) when $\\nu = \\infty$ and (b) when $\\nu = 1$. We assume that the densities $f_\\theta$ form an exponential family and that the distribution of $\\log(f_\\nu(X_1)/f_0(X_1))$ is (strongly) nonlattice. Monte Carlo studies indicate that the asymptotic expressions are very good approximations, even when the expected sample sizes are small."
