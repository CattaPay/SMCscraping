"Let $x_1, x_2,\\cdots$ be independent random variables which under $P_\\theta$ have probability density function of the form $P_\\theta\\{x_k \\in dx\\} = \\exp(\\theta x - \\Psi(\\theta)) dH(x)$, where $\\Psi$ is normalized so that $\\Psi(0) = \\Psi'(0) = 0.$ Let $a \\leqq 0   0$ is defined by $\\Psi(w) = \\Psi(u)$, is an asymptotically (as $b \\rightarrow \\infty)$ optimal choice of $\\theta$ in a sense to be defined. Implications of this result for Monte Carlo studies in sequential analysis are discussed."
