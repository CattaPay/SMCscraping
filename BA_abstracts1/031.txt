"We introduce a new approach to simulating rare events for Markov random walks with heavy-tailed increments. This approach involves sequential importance sampling and resampling, and uses a martingale representation of the corresponding estimate of the rare-event probability to show that it is unbiased and to bound its variance. By choosing the importance measures and resampling weights suitably, it is shown how this approach can yield asymptotically efficient Monte Carlo estimates."
