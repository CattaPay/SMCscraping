"The probability that a stochastic process with negative drift exceed a value a often has a renewal-theoretic approximation as $a \\to \\infty$. Except for a process of iid random variables, this approximation involves a constant which is not amenable to analytic calculation. Naive simulation of this constant has the drawback of necessitating a choice of finite a, thereby hurting assessment of the precision of a Monte Carlo simulation estimate, as the effect of the discrepancy between a and $\\infty$ is usually difficult to evaluate. Here we suggest a new way of representing the constant. Our approach enables simulation of the constant with prescribed accuracy. We exemplify our approach by working out the details of a sequential power one hypothesis testing problem of whether a sequence of observations is iid standard normal against the alternative that the sequence is AR(1). Monte Carlo results are reported."
