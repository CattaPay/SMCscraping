"By integrating the cardinality balanced multitarget multi-Bernoulli (CBMeMBer) filter with the interacting multiple models (IMM) algorithm, an MM-CBMeMBer filter is proposed in this paper for tracking multiple maneuvering targets in clutter. The sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) method is used to implement the filter for generic multi-target models and the Gaussian mixture (GM) method is used to implement the filter for linear-Gaussian multi-target models. Then, the extended Kalman (EK) and unscented Kalman filtering approximations for the GM-MM-CBMeMBer filter to accommodate mildly nonlinear models are described briefly. Simulation results are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed filter."
