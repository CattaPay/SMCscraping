"Many applications in Bayesian statistics are extremely computationally intensive. However, they are often inherently parallel, making them prime targets for modern massively parallel processors. Multi-core and distributed computing is widely applied in the Bayesian community, however, very little attention has been given to fine-grain parallelisation using single instruction multiple data (SIMD) operations that are available on most modern CPUs. In this work, we practically demonstrate, using standard programming libraries, the utility of the SIMD approach for several topical Bayesian applications. Using the C programming language, we show that SIMD can improve the single-core floating point arithmetic performance by up to a factor of 6× compared scalar C code and more than 25× compared with optimised R code. Such improvements are multiplicative to any gains achieved through multi-core processing. We illustrate the potential of SIMD for accelerating Bayesian computations and provide the reader with techniques for exploiting modern massively parallel processing environments."
